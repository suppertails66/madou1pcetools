This package contains the source materials (code/art/script) for the English 
translation project for the PC-Engine CD game Madou Monogatari I: Honoo no 
Sotsuenji.

The build system is only set up for Unix-like systems, though none of the code 
is fundamentally dependent on this and could be ported with a bit of effort. 
You'll need GCC, libpng, and ImageMagick (the "convert" utility), as well as any
dependencies of wla-dx.

You'll first need a disc image of Madou Monogatari I: Honoo no Sotsuenji for the 
PC-Engine CD. The Redump-verified image is highly suggested, though other images 
may work if they're a close enough match.

  Redump name: Madou Monogatari I: Honoo no Sotsuenji
  CRC32:       c9725820
  MD5:         59c01f94b3c991c3509620430cf95c0a
  SHA-1:       8e583b2c38736871aa44ba842291f257f9b5af34

The disc image must be in ISO+WAV+CUE format. If you need to convert from a 
different format, try using bchunk.

Once you have an ISO+WAV+CUE image, rename the files such that every track is 
named as "madou1_01.wav", "madou1_02.iso", and so on up through "madou1_32.iso". 
Copy these files into the "madou1pce" directory. Then:

$ cd madou1pce
$ ./build.sh

build.sh should then build all the necessary tools and output the translated ISO 
for track 2 as "madou1_02_build.iso". Use the provided "madou1_iso_build.cue" 
CUE sheet to run the built disc.

If you want to modify the project, check build.sh to see where the resources 
that get inserted into the game are coming from.
